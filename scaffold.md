## Key Components

### 1. Main Application (`KeyVisualizer_v2.html`)
A single HTML file containing:
- **UI Structure**: File upload, MCU selection, view toggle button, and keyboard stage.
- **Styling**: Modern, dark-themed CSS with clear visual feedback for interactive elements.
- **Logic**:
  - Parses uploaded QMK JSON files to map the physical layout.
  - Contains a custom C parser to read and associate QMK `LAYOUT` macros from `keymap.c` files.
  - Matches the physical layout properties (x, y, w, h).
  - Associates matrix positions `[row, col]` with predefined MCU pin profiles.
  - Renders interactive SVGs to visualize matrix wiring paths using ribbon cable color coding.
  - Handles the mirroring logic for the bottom (soldering) view and layer switching for top view.

### 2. Layout Configurations (`*.json`)
These files define the physical key layout and the matrix structure, extracted from tools like QMK Configurator or a keyboard's source code. They are consumed by the visualizer to render the keyboard.
