# QMK Wiring Visualizer 2.0 (Handwire Edition)

## Description

The **QMK Wiring Visualizer 2.0** is a web-based, single-page application designed to simplify the process of handwiring custom keyboards. It reads QMK keyboard configuration JSON files and visually maps the physical layout directly to microcontroller pins. This tool bridges the gap between digital configurations and the physical soldering process.

## Features

- **JSON Upload**: Directly upload your QMK `keyboard.json` configuration file.
- **Multiple MCU Profiles**: Built-in pinout support for popular microcontrollers:
  - Raspberry Pi RP2040-Zero
  - Raspberry Pi RP2040-Tiny
  - Arduino Pro Micro (AVR)
  - ZMK nice!nano (nRF52840)
  - ZMK NRF52840 Dev Board (nice!nano V2.0 Compatible)
- **Top and Bottom Views**: Toggle between viewing the keyboard from the top (keycaps) and the bottom (wiring/solder view, which horizontally mirrors the layout).
- **Interactive Tooltips**: Hover over keys to see exact matrix coordinates `[row, col]` and the specific pins to solder for your selected MCU.
- **Hardware Peripherals Panel**: Dynamically displays recommended or JSON-configured pins for OLED displays (I2C SDA/SCL) and Rotary Encoders (Pin A/Pin B).
- **Interactive Encoder Assignment**: Click the "🎯 Assign Encoders" button to convert any key in the visualizer into a Rotary Encoder, visually transforming it and updating its wiring tooltips.
- **Export Capabilities**:
  - **💾 Save JSON**: Instantly inject your encoder and I2C pin assignments into your `keyboard.json` and download the updated layout file.
  - **📄 Copy C Code**: Generates standard QMK `encoder_update_user` boilerplate for your `keymap.c` file based on your assigned encoders.
- **Standalone App**: Entirely contained in a single HTML file—no server or installation required.

## Usage

1. Open `KeyVisualizer_v2.html` in any modern web browser.
2. Click the file input to upload your `keyboard.json` layout file.
3. Select your microcontroller profile from the dropdown.
4. Toggle the view to "Bottom (Wiring/Solder)" when you are ready to solder.
5. Hover over any key to view the matrix positions and target pins.

## Getting Started

To test out the visualizer, you can use the provided `keyboard.json` or `splitkb_aurora_lily58_rev1_layout_*.json` files included in the project directory.

Welcome to the **Lily58 Zero** repository. This is a custom, handwired split keyboard powered by the RP2040 microcontroller. 

## 🛠️ Hardware Specifications

* **Keyboard:** Lily58 (58 keys)
* **Build Type:** Custom Handwired 
* **Microcontroller:** RP2040 (e.g., RP2040-Tiny)
* **Bootloader:** `rp2040`
* **Diode Direction:** `COL2ROW`
* **Communication:** Serial (Half-Duplex)

## 📍 Pinout Matrix (RP2040)

Both the left and right halves are mirrored and use the exact same microcontroller pins.

* **Rows (5):** `GP0`, `GP1`, `GP2`, `GP3`, `GP4`
* **Columns (6):** `GP10`, `GP9`, `GP8`, `GP7`, `GP6`, `GP5`
* **Split Serial Communication:** `GP15`

## 🧠 Keymap Architecture

The firmware utilizes a robust Tri-Layer logic system:
*Layer 0 (Base):** Standard QWERTY layout with ergonomic thumb modifiers.
**Layer 1 (Lower):** F-Keys, Numpad, and navigation cluster. Accessed by holding `MO(1)` (Left inner thumb).
**Layer 2 (Raise):**Symbols, numbers, and secondary navigation. Accessed by holding `MO(2)` (Right inner thumb).
**Layer 3 (System):**RGB/Lighting controls. Accessed by holding both `MO(1)` and `MO(2)` simultaneously.

## 🚀 Flashing Instructions

To compile and flash the firmware using the QMK CLI, follow these exact steps:

1. **Verify Directory:** Ensure your files are placed in:
   `~/qmk_firmware/keyboards/handwired/lily58_zero/`
2. **Clean Build:** Run the compile command with the `-c` flag to prevent cached errors:
